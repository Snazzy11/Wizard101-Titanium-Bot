# Wizard101-Titanium-Bot
Wizard101 titanium-purchasing bot.

IMPORTANT: THIS IS A BOT THAT TAKES CONTROL OF YOUR MOUSE. IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, THE PROGRAM WILL NOT 
KNOW, AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO CLICK ABOUT THE SCREEN. IF THIS HAPPENS, TRY TO MOVE YOUR MOUSE TO THE
TOP LEFT CORNER OF YOUR MONITOR AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THIS SHOULD ACTIVATE A FAILSAFE THAT SHUTS DOWN THE 
PROGRAM. I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACTIONS THE BOT TAKES IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO STOP THE PROGRAM.

This is a bot, made in Python, that purchases titanium from the Wizard101 market. It always attempts to
purchase the entirety of the bundle that is on sale, so you need to have enough money to buy it. 

I do not support botting or cheating in video games, this bot was only made because some people have 
a slower connection, reaction time, or other reasons that make it difficult to purchase the rare
items from the shop; particularly when others are botting.

I made this program many months ago when I was still a complete novice. As a result of that,
everything is currently hard-coded. This means that, currently, this will ONLY work with titanium, 
and ONLY work on a 1080p monitor, where Wizard101 is configured to take up the entire screen.
If you have a 1440p monitor, try running the game windowed with the game pushed all the way into the 
top-left corner of your monitor. The program being hard-coded ALSO means that you can only currently 
search for titanium. This is because the bot always skips to the last page of the shop. The letter 't' occurs
late enough in the alphabet that the bot can simply skip to the final screen rather than search each page for
titanium.

I do not personally play Wizard101, so it is unlikely (but not impossible) that I will ever update this code
to make it search for other resources. However, I was able to write this program as a novice, and I am sure
that other beginner to intermediate programmers can find ways to update it for their needs. Check the
PyAutoGUI documentation for help if you plan on forking this code. 

Please note that this program is under a GNU GPLv3 license.
